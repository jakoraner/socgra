### Project A – 60s Video: “Movies as a Network of Ideas” (Simple, one speaker)

Goal: Single person presents the project in an empty cinema. Minimal shots, clear overlays from your notebook. Total 60s, easy to shoot and edit.

### Structure (timecoded, 5 beats, one speaker)
0–8s — Intro on camera  
- Shot: Presenter seated in the cinema, projector on behind them. Static tripod.  
- Dialogue (on‑camera): “What if movies aren’t just rated—but connected by ideas?”  
- Overlay: Title (center): “Movies as a Network of Ideas”.

9–20s — Data and text idea  
- Shot: Over‑shoulder to laptop (cutaway) or remain on presenter.  
- Voiceover (same speaker): “We use MovieLens data. From audience tags, TF‑IDF turns words into meaning, and LDA groups them into topics.”  
- Overlay: 2–3 word clouds (`figures/topic_0_wordcloud.png` … choose best). Quick cross‑dissolves.  
- Lower‑third: “Data: movies, ratings, tags, links”.

21–38s — Building the network  
- Shot: Presenter VO over a full‑screen network figure.  
- Voiceover: “Each movie is a node. We connect nearest neighbors by semantic similarity to form a movie‑to‑movie graph.”  
- Overlay: LCC network PNG (dark background). Add slow zoom (Ken Burns).  
- On‑screen text: “Nodes=#### • Edges=#### • Avg degree=#.#” (fill from your run).

39–52s — What we see  
- Shot: Presenter back on camera (medium).  
- Voiceover: “Communities appear—genres, moods, eras—and some films act as bridges.”  
- Overlay: Communities bar chart (quick 1–2s) then network colored by dominant topic.

53–60s — Close and next steps  
- Shot: Presenter on camera.  
- Dialogue: “This is a map of cinema drawn by audience language. Next, we’ll compare clusters with topics and explore how influence travels.”  
- End card: Project title + team names (2s).

### One‑speaker script (fits 60s)
“What if movies aren’t just rated—but connected by ideas? We use MovieLens data. From audience tags, TF‑IDF turns words into meaning, and LDA reveals topics. Each film becomes a node; we connect nearest neighbors by semantic similarity to build a movie network. A structure emerges: communities—genres, moods, eras—and bridges that link them. Finally, we relate topic strength to network position to spot influential films. This is a map of cinema, drawn by audience language. Next, we’ll compare clusters and topics and explore how influence travels.”

### Assets to prepare (from notebook)
- Word clouds: pick 2–3 best from `figures/topic_*.png`.  
- Network LCC plot: one clean PNG (dark background).  
- Network colored by dominant topic: one PNG.  
- Communities bar chart: one PNG.  
- Optional: degree distribution PNG (use as subtle background for 1s).

### Quick shooting checklist (feasible)
- Location: empty cinema or dark classroom with projector.  
- Gear: phone or DSLR on tripod; clip‑on mic or quiet room.  
- Shots to capture: presenter A‑roll (intro, bridge, close), over‑shoulder laptop (optional).  
- Audio: record one speaker; keep room quiet.

### Quick editing checklist
- Place A‑roll at 0–8s, 39–52s, and 53–60s.  
- Insert overlays at 9–38s as full‑screen with slow zooms.  
- Use simple cuts and 8–10 frame cross‑dissolves.  
- Titles/lower‑thirds: Inter/Roboto; keep text short.  
- Export H.264, 1080p, ~15–20 Mbps.
